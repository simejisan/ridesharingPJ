# Ridesharing Project
Requirement Engineering Course 

This ridesharing system is designed to speed up the procedure of finding a suitable
traveller for staff and students within the VNU area. The system allows drivers to sign up
for rides - passengers meanwhile have access to the list of available drivers and then, per
request, ask for permission to join the ride.

This document is used to define terminology specific to the problem domain, explaining
terms, which may be unfamiliar to the reader of the use-case descriptions or other project
documents. Often, this document can be used as an informal data dictionary, capturing
data definitions so that use-case descriptions of other project documents can focus on
what the system must do with the information.
